# Model-guided mutation (MGM)

The following subpackages are included in this repository:

1. `algorithms`: Algorithms for model-guided mutation
2. `common`: Subpackage for common classes and functions used throughout the package, such as the `Sequence` class
3. `data`: Subpackage for data generation, pre-preprocessing, and model training
4. `pipelines`: Implementations of various experimental pipelines
5. `testing`: Testing utilities for the `mgm` package


Notes to self - next steps:
* Create data subpackage: load Kuzmin data, big bang sequence generation using HMM
* Write a simple pipeline - consider merging old pipelines code
